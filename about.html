    <br>
    <p>
		Hi, I'm Joann. This is my first design portfolio. I am excited to train in my field of interest as a Front End Web Developer. I am currently taking courses for the Front-End Development track program with Code Louisville by Kentuckiana Works. I also have the basics in EPUB management, basics of HTML, CSS, FTP, and HeidiSQL training from my previous employer.
		I am a proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated and a volunteer with other various organizations.
	<p>
		I graduated in the Health Informatics Masterâ€™s Program at Walden University Distance Learning Graduate School in 2011. 
		The program focuses on the development, implementation, evaluation, and management of healthcare solutions to improve patient health and healthcare delivery processes.
		
		I will be a key contributor in upholding the goals and values of your company. My work experiences have been a positive one due to my interpersonal skills. I am very reliable and well-organized, work well with others, and very eager to learn new things with your company. 
		I also believe that my educational and career background strongly makes me to be an excellent candidate for this position.
